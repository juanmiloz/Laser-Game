# laser-game  
The application consists of creating a matrix with hidden mirrors and a laser beam must enter through some edge of the matrix, this beam can bounce off the mirrors and change their direction. The program must only show where the beam enters and exits and the user must guess all the positions of the mirrors. When finding all the mirrors or typing menu the player's score will be calculated and saved in a binary tree. To develop all of the above, it was not allowed to use any type of cycle, or container variables
